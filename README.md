Simulation of Player Rotations in a Basketball Game

Player ages are given through file input and determine the amount of minutes a player will remain in the game before heading to the bench. Queues are used to determine when a player will leave the game and how long they'll stay on the bench afterwards. Minutes are dependent on the players age: younger players will play more minutes a time and vicve versa.
